tex file code for version controlled resumes


current_resume.tex is a dynamic file that will always be changing based on the state/time of the resume - so any .tex file in the year folders can identify as current_resume.tex, but this file is to only be used to represent the current resume 

This repository will also be tied to nicolod.org and will fetch current_resume.tex to provide the current most up to date resume that i have updated.
this feature design is to account for version control for when i change/update resumes
